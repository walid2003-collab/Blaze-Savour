# Communication Tone & Copy Guide: Blaze-Savour

This document ensures consistent, clear, benefit-led copy throughout the storefront.

---

## 1. Tone Principles

### Core Tone: Direct, Commerce-Focused, Conversion-Oriented

**What we are:**
- Concise and benefit-led (focus on "what's in it for the customer")
- Professional but approachable
- Action-oriented (clear CTAs)
- Honest and trustworthy (no hype)

**What we're not:**
- Playful or whimsical (unless brand explicitly is)
- Overpromising or salesy ("Amazing savings!" without specifics)
- Overly formal or jargon-heavy
- Vague ("Great deals" vs "Save 20%")

### Example Contrasts

| ❌ Don't | ✓ Do |
|---------|------|
| "Awesome deals await!" | "Save 20% on new arrivals" |
| "Limited time offer" (too vague) | "Sale ends Sunday at midnight" (specific) |
| "You won't believe this!" | "Get free shipping on orders over $50" (clear benefit) |
| "Premium collection" | "Timeless pieces built to last" (concrete feature) |
| "Act now!!!" | "Add to cart" (calm, clear) |

## 3. CTAs (Call-to-Action Buttons)

### Primary CTA (brand color, solid fill)

- **`Add to Cart`** – Most common (not "Add item" or "Buy now" unless context different)
- **`Sign Up`** – Newsletter, account
- **`Shop Now`** – From hero banner or announcement
- **`Continue`** – Multi-step flows
- **`Submit`** – Forms (consider context)

### Secondary CTA (outline or muted)

- **`Learn More`** – From announcement
- **`View Details`** – From card
- **`Browse All`** – From filtered view
- **`Cancel`** or **`Close`** – From modal
- **`Skip`** – Optional step in flow

### Tertiary CTA (text link)

- **`View cart`** – After add-to-cart
- **`Continue shopping`** – After add-to-cart
- **`Notify me`** – When out of stock
- **`Remove`** – From cart
- **`Unsubscribe`** – In email

## 4. Prohibited / Red Flags

❌ **Never use:**

1. **Overpromised inventory ("Only 3 left!" if we have 100+)**
   - Risk: Violates FTC regulations + damages trust
   - Correct: Use real stock count from Shopify

2. **Misleading prices ("Was $99" if it was never actually $99)**
   - Risk: Violates FTC guidelines + damages trust
   - Correct: Only show compare-at if it was actually sold at that price

3. **Urgency without reason ("Act now!!!")**
   - Risk: Feels manipulative; damages conversion if fake
   - Correct: Give specific reason ("Sale ends Sunday") or remove

4. **Unsupported medical / health claims**
   - Risk: Legal liability (FDA, FTC will fine)
   - Example: "This serum cures acne" → "This serum may help reduce blemishes"
   - Correct: Use "may help," "promotes," "supports" language

5. **Comparison to competitors**
   - Risk: Competitor lawsuits
   - Example: "Better than Brand X" ❌
   - Correct: Let product speak for itself

6. **Assumed customer characteristics**
   - Risk: Alienates audience; seems unprofessional
   - Example: "Girls love this!" ❌ (assumes gender)
   - Correct: "A bestseller" or "Often paired with..."

7. **All caps for general text (OK for acronyms, prices)**
   - Example: "CLICK HERE NOW FOR AMAZING DEALS!!!" ❌
   - Correct: "Shop our sale"

8. **Multiple exclamation marks ("Great deal!!!**)**
   - Reads as shouting / unprofessional
   - Correct: One per sentence max, used sparingly

## 5. Product Description Best Practices

### Do

✓ **Lead with benefits, not specs**
```
Modern fit with breathable fabric keeps you cool.
(not: "Made from 92% polyester, 8% spandex")
```

✓ **Be specific**
```
Free shipping on orders over $50 to continental US.
(not: "Free shipping available")
```

✓ **Use active voice**
```
This pillow reduces neck strain.
(not: "Neck strain is reduced by this pillow")
```

✓ **Answer customer questions**
```
Fits true to size. (Answer: "Does it run small?")
Includes 2 year warranty. (Answer: "Is it covered?")
```

### Don't

❌ **Vague claims without proof**
```
"Best quality" (compared to what? who says?)
```

❌ **Feature dumping without context**
```
"Titanium alloy construction, 0.3mm thickness, ISO 9001 certified"
(Customer doesn't care about ISO cert; say what benefit it brings)
```

## 6. Localization Notes

When translating copy:

- **Dates & times:** Use locale-specific format (e.g., DD/MM/YYYY for EU)
- **Currency:** Use correct symbol + decimal places (€5,00 vs $5.00)
- **Urgency language:** Different cultures interpret "Act now" differently; test with local merchants
- **Measurements:** Convert to locale units (inches → cm in EU)
- **Holidays/cultural refs:** Don't assume Christmas is relevant everywhere

**Localized copy in `/locales/*.json`:**

```json
{
  "products": {
    "add_to_cart": "Add to Cart",
    "low_stock": "Only {{ count }} left in stock",
    "shipping": "Free shipping on orders over {{ amount }}"
  }
}
```

Use in Liquid via `{{ 'products.add_to_cart' | t }}`.

## 7. Examples in Current Theme

### ✓ Good Copy (Current Code)

**From announcements:**
```
Free shipping on orders over $50
```
(Specific, benefit-led, no hype)

**From product cards:**
```
Only 3 left in stock
```
(Clear inventory status; limited if truly limited)

**From facets:**
```
No products found. Try adjusting your filters or search terms.
```
(Helpful next steps)

### TODO: Copy Audit

- [ ] Audit all announcement copy in live store
- [ ] Verify price claims match product history
- [ ] Check for overpromised stock warnings
- [ ] Review error messages for tone consistency
- [ ] Test with real customer feedback

---

## 8. Brand Voice for Different Contexts

### Casual / Friendly (if brand is approachable)

```
Hey there! Can't find what you're looking for?
We'd love to help.
```

### Professional / Luxury (if brand is premium)

```
Explore our curated collection.
Each piece is selected for quality and timeless appeal.
```

### Direct / Functional (if brand is utility-focused)

```
Filter products. Find what you need. Move on.
```

**Choose ONE voice and stick to it.** Don't mix casual + professional in the same page.

## 9. Copy Review Checklist

Before shipping new copy:

- [ ] Is it benefit-led? (What's in it for the customer?)
- [ ] Is it specific? (Avoid vague: "Great deal" → "Save 20%")
- [ ] Is it honest? (No overpromising or misleading claims)
- [ ] Is it legal? (No medical/health claims, no competitor comparisons)
- [ ] Is it on-brand? (Matches established tone)
- [ ] Is it accessible? (Clear language; no jargon)
- [ ] Is it localized? (Dates, currency, cultural refs checked)
- [ ] Is it consistent? (Same feature named same way throughout)
